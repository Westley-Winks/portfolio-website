  # About

  descripe_l1_person: "Hi, I'm Westley. I love people and humanity. My mission in life is to get people access to basic needs like food, water, and education. I want to use data to accomplish that."
  descripe_l2_person: "After graduating from Oregon State University with a Bachelorâ€™s in Chemical Engineering, I moved to Central Oregon and was patiently waiting to leave for the Peace Corps when COVID hit and delayed those plans. Instead, I searched for a career path that led me towards my mission and found it in the field of data. I took a course in data analytics and truly loved it. I pitched a data analytics job to a local non-profit in my area and was hired as a data analyst, an opening they had never considered. I am continually learning and have a full pipeline of project ideas and courses to practice my data skills. I know that I can use data for good (actual good, not just a buzzword) and use my abilities to really help people."
